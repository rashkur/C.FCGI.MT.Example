## C FCGI Multithread Example  
I wrote this code to learn C language a little more.  
It's not leaking memory on mutex so you can use it like a basis for your own experements.  
Can process queries like ``` /query1?arg1======123qwe게&arg2=145%206АДЖИ가%20게 가셨어요&arg3=test123&arg4&arg5=232323=asdda====asd&3qe&&&&&3zz=&=asas&arg3=aasasas ```
and respect repeating args
